# cgisf_lib

A random sentence generator, still without commas.

Has three functions:
- `cgisf()`, to generate a sentence;
- `get_word()`, to generate a word of a certain kind; and
- `get_structure()`, to get the structure of a sentence.

cgisf is a reference to 'Colourless Green Ideas Sleep Furiously' - a 1957 example of a sentence that is grammatical but makes no sense.
Similarly, don't expect these sentences to make that much sense either.

The documentation is significantly better than this silly README file.
